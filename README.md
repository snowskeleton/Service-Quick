Various scripts for making life easier at this back-asswards company.

Eanor.exe is for text replacement (eg., typing "lm" and having it output "called to schedule lmom")

Scripts.exe is for most everything else (eg., pressing alt+t will open up a ticket log)

Send Callfire.exe is for supervisors. It does what it says on the box.


You can look at what triggers text replacment and various scripts by opening the associated .ahk file in Notepad.

Text replacment is formated "::[short text]::long text". An example is below:
::lm::called to schedule lmom

Scripts are formated "[keystroke::script]". Most, if not all, scripts have a comment describing what they do and in which situation they should be used.
